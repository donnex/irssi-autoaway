What
====
It's the "default" Irssi autoaway script (http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/autoaway.pl) restructured and with some fixes.

Why
===
The default script never worked quite right for my shell users. They had to run the /autoaway command on every Irssi startup and often forgot.
This version also fixes some edge cases and some minor bugs.
